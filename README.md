# 👨‍🔬 Pei Syang | Pharmacy Professor & Computational Chemist

Hi there! I'm Syang, a pharmacy professor on a mission to develop life-saving drugs and **explore the future of computational chemistry** 💊💻. When I’m not in the lab or teaching, you’ll find me skateboarding with my daughter 🛹, flying drones 🚁, or digging into the **quirky side of meme culture** 🤖.

## 💻 Tech Stack

Techs that I’ve used at least once (and often fell down the rabbit hole):

- 🧬 Schrödinger Suite (Maestro, Glide, LigPrep)
- 🧪 RDKit | Open Babel | MarvinSketch
- 🔬 Cross coupling | MPLC purification | NMR | LCMS 
- 🧠 AI for Drug Design (Rockville, Boltz-2, DeepPurpose)
- 🧰 Python | SLURM | Bash | Jupyter
- 🌐 SciFinder | PubChem | PDB | ChEMBL

## 🌱 Currently Learning & Exploring

- 🤖 **AI-Powered QSAR Modeling** for novel kinase inhibitors
- 🔗 **PROTAC Design** with first-in-class Targets
- 🧩 **Multi-target Docking & Virtual Screening**
- 🔬 **Drug hunter in Chemistry space**
- 🌌 **Biotin probe synthesis for target protein identification**
- 📍 **Visual Grounding for Molecular Structures**
